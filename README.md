I made this analog clock ‚è∞ using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It applies geometric principles to create the circular layout of the clock. The clock hands are rotated using mathematical calculations. The hour hand moves 30 degrees for each hour, plus an additional half-degree for each minute. The minute hand moves 6 degrees for every minute, and the second hand rotates 6 degrees per second and it uses JavaScript's setInterval() function to update the clock's time every second.
